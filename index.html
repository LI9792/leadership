      <h3>Self-Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is LI JIAJUN, and I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Education.
        I am deeply interested in the field of education, especially topics related to curriculum development and curriculum design.
        I enjoy thinking about questions such as “What should students learn?” and “How can learning be more effective?”
        In the future, I hope to contribute to curriculum improvement and teaching enhancement, making learning more aligned with students’ real needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies, I focus on combining theory with practice. I pay attention to the connections among curriculum standards,
        learning objectives, classroom implementation, and learning assessment. In the future, I hope to further develop my abilities in
        curriculum development, instructional design, and educational research, gradually shaping my own professional direction.

    <!-- 2. Course Reflection -->
    <section id="reflection" class="card">
      <h2>2. Overall Reflection on the Leadership Course (Before & After)</h2>

      <h3>(1) Before Taking the Course: My Understanding of Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        Before taking the leadership course, my understanding of leadership was relatively straightforward. I believed leadership mainly came
        from “position” or “authority,” and it was more like a management skill: assigning tasks, arranging processes, and supervising results.
        I also used to think leadership was a trait that only a few people naturally had, while ordinary members had limited chances to lead.
      </p>

      <h3>(2) After Taking the Course: What I Learned and How I Changed</h3>
      <p>
        Through this course, I gradually realized that leadership is not only about “managing others,” but also about influencing a team,
        driving change, and supporting collective growth. A leader needs a clear sense of goals and values, as well as the ability to listen
        and communicate effectively, helping team members recognize their strengths and roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also came to understand that leadership is not limited to formal roles in an organization. Everyone can show leadership in teamwork,
        such as coordinating tasks proactively, supporting peers, and providing direction and encouragement when challenges arise.
      </p>

      <h3>(3) Future Application Plan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Communicate more proactively in teamwork and clarify task allocation and timelines</li>
        <li>Understand others’ perspectives first when conflicts occur, then seek solutions and consensus</li>
        <li>Motivate the team through encouragement and recognition to strengthen engagement</li>
        <li>Develop my organization, communication, and influence skills through learning and practice</li>
      </ul>

        Transformational leadership is a leadership approach that influences team members through vision and shared values.
        It not only focuses on task completion, but also inspires internal motivation, encouraging individuals to go beyond personal interests
        and work together to promote organizational development and positive change.
